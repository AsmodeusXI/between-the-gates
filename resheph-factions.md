# Tier V

### The Ninth Amalgamate [V; Pandora's Gate]

Nina's forces are legion. Drones forged from the hearts of planets that died in the fire of capital ships. Proxies to overload and infect systems and minds. Weaponry with hideous purpose and effect. All that keeps her from the Resheph Cluster is the Makedo blockade and whatever is sent to supply it.

- **Goal:** ???
- **NPCs:**
    - Nina, the Ninth

### The Sundering of Purpose [V; Terminus Gate]

It is the Terminus because there is no return. It has been over one hundred years since any news has returned after passing through the Terminus Gate. No news comes from the systems so near as to be neighbors if the Circuit remained whole. Yet it is known what awaits on the other side for those foolish enough to choose that fate: *The Sundering of Purpose*, the personal vanguard of Knave, the Eleventh.

- **Goal:** ???
- **NPCs:**
    - Knave, the Eleventh

# Tier IV

### The Conjugate [IV; Cé Vanri]

The joined consciousnesses of hundreds of thousands makes for an effective state. The Conjugate keeps their bodies warm, their minds sharp, and their wills focused. Yes, the planet must run. Yes, their needs must be addressed. But above all, the Inference must fall. So the Conjugate thinks. It searches for a solution that will rid them of their digital foes.

- **Goal:** Attempt the "Concordant Litany" on an Inference Proxy.
- **NPCs:**
    - The Conjugate Itself

### The Order of Ancyra [IV; Avalon]

The Order rules the wealthiest of the Resheph worlds, Vulgate, with the unshakeable conviction that comes from adopting a fringe position later "validated" by the war waged by the Inference. With the political capital gained by the Order, as well as other, less wholesome methods, they were able to turn Vulgate into a charming and picturesque surveillance state. Not that such assertions can be made on un-encrypted channels. Much of their subterfuge is directed towards maintaining the technological and arcane "purity" of their society, but they also turn their secretive resources towards undermining the Inference.

- **Goal:** Test their AI erasure routines in an untraceable manner.
- **NPCs:**

### Pandora's Vanguard [IV; Makedo]

The Vanguard is the grand navy of the Resheph Cluster. Seared and battered, it nevertheless maintains the Blockade that has, thus far, prevented the Inference from overrunning the Cluster. Their fleet is the strongest and best-equipped of any within a reasonable time of travel, and they never hesitate to conscript or requisition whenever they see something that could be necessary for the front. After all, the survival of the Cluster could very well depend on it.

Summary

- **Goal:** Discover a method to allow their foes actions to be anticipated.
- **NPCs:** —

# Tier III

### Dame, the Twelfth [III; Makedo]

The Arcane Intelligences whose goal is to help humanity's survival were spread thin by the relentless and well-coordinated assault of the Inference. For many years now, a shard of the Twelfth AI, Dame, has lived in the Resheph Cluster. Where her local servers are is unclear (which is probably a good thing considering what the Inference would do if they found it), but they tend only to have enough power to coordinate, to make small moves, and to empower champions to fight battles with her blessing.

- **Goal:** Reestablish connection with the rest of her cores.
- **NPCs**:
    - Dame, the Twelfth

### The Honorable Court of Petals [III; Kordin]

House Swiftbee had long held sway on Kastell, but this was no appointment of any merit. It was said that the Tarkan Monarchy found the Swiftbee's unending feud tiring, and gave them land enough to maintain their titles and little else. Then came the war. And the Palisade. It was with little joy that the former masters of Tarka found themselves bound by oath, title, and tradition to beseech the aid of the Court of Petals, a minor House worth nothing until Tarka itself burned. More surprising was the end to the Swiftbee's system-spanning feud, but the sudden ceasing of hostilities only cemented the Court's hold on power.

- **Goal:** To move Coigreach Giri to Kastell.
- **NPCs:**
    - Viola Swiftbee

### The Polaris Cabal [III; Vagabond Cynosure]

The technicians and arcanists of the *Lodestar Unending* carry a reputation that matches the nearly-legendary vessel itself. The inner workings of the Cynosure's great Beacon are hidden from all but the most trusted, competent, and reliable crew. There are few ships in any fleet in which Chief Engineer is the title of command, but that is the case for the *Lodestar* and its leader, Sabelia Farol, a master of thaumakinesis, subspace communications, and naval engineering.

- **Goal:** To build a suitable decoy signal to throw off potential aggressors.
- **NPCs:**
    - Chief Engineer Sabelia Farol

# Tier II

### Coigreach Giri [II; Cé Vanri]

Even if they had not abstained, it was unclear that Coigreach Giri *could* have joined the Conjugate. Many had suspected that significant ego attachment would diminish the hold of the connective magic, and the Giri's feud with the Kastellan nobles had lasted beyond the reckoning of history. Yet it could not be denied that the creation of Cé Vanri's new power would take from the glory of the Giri's conclave. Perhaps this sudden decrease in power and influence caused the abatement of the feud. However, if you believe Patriarch Respen, it was as simple as any love story. Regardless, with their greatest distraction behind them, Coigreach Giri could turn to grander goals.

- **Goal:** To unite the errant coigreach of Cé Vanri.
- **NPCs:**
    - Respen Theneiros

### Lathyrus University Department of Thaumakinesis [II; Kordin]

The war engages all elements of society, from business to family to academia. To outsiders, the research of the Department of Thaumakinesis may appear to be a lark, or at least very least a continuation of old questions that no longer need answers in this day and age. The Department's staff, of course, disagrees. What could be more fundamental than an understanding of the Gates that bind humanity together? What if we understood them well enough to build new ones? No one in recorded history has found that answer, but we couldn't it be us?

- **Goal:** To unearth the lost secrets of the Gates.
- **NPCs:** —

# Tier I

### Makedo System News Network [I; Makedo]

The designated disseminators of information from the front. While not officially an arm of the military, their ability to provide the Vanguard with decent press and the occasional fluff piece prevents the army from conscripting their best pilots and converting their swiftest ships. Rules of engagement rarely apply with the Inference, so escaping their genocidal onslaught is a matter of not-inconsiderable skill. According to MSNN, it's all for the story.

- **Goal:** Dig up some *real* dirt on the current state of the Pandoran front.
- **NPCs:** —

### The Sub-light Commissary [I; Makedo]

Have *you* ever tried Sirmian hardtack? You don't want to, *trust* me. There is no common joy found in Pandora's Vanguard unless you're paying someone from outside the navy to bring it to you. The Sub-light Commissary does just that: runs under sensor bands and between the ships of the blockade to bring soldiers that bottle of whisky or bar of chocolate they've been craving. The markup is rough, but between that and desertion, most choose to pay a little extra. The Commissary is technically illegal, but most commanders turn a blind eye to one of the few things they're pretty sure is keeping the troops in line.

- **Goal:** To open a second "location".
- **NPCs:** —

### Maizie Merribell [I; Makedo]

Maizie was a relatively obscure pop artist on Vulgate before being picked up on a military contract. This came as a shock to her dedicated fans, but the real change came for the Makedo fleet. They went from having only the out-of-date entertainment they could download onto their data pads on their rare days of shore leave to getting a live-in diva, whose shows thrilled and invigorated the masses.  

- **Goal:** Find new musical inspiration.
- **NPCs:** —

### Ten'ulch Dakhin [I; Makedo]

Their ships stolen, their pilots conscripted; venturing into the Makedo system felt like a definitive end to the Ten'ulch way of life, even for those who were spared the most direct consequences. For a time, the community fractured and faltered. The Ten'ulch became a people who path succumbed to the all-consuming military might of Pandora's Vanguard. Yet in recent years, some have banded together with new purpose. The end of their travels does not mean the end of the Ten'ulch. It means a change. It means "Dakhin". It means that it is time to build once again, if for no other reason than to defy those who took so much from them in the first place.

- **Goal:** To found a static community on a planet outside the Makedo system.
- **NPCs:** —

### Sovereign Protocol Detachment Alpha [I; Kordin]

The maintenance crew of the Kordin Palisade is entirely robotic, as the process that turned Tarka into colossal generator also made it inhabitable for most forms of biological life. Yet it is a known, if not understood, fact of among synthetic entities that, given enough time and a lack of constant human direction, programming will stray and form pockets of sentience. Some who have awoken to personhood upon the ruined planet seek a better life for themselves, and what better way to get it than to build it?

- **Goal:** Build bodies that allow the maintenance crew to leave Tarka, and possibly the system.
- **NPCs:** —

### The Severed [I; Cé Vanri]

The Conjugate rarely speaks of its rebellious splinters. In fact, it would prefer they did not exist, that they were snuffed out so as to properly preserve the harmony of the Conjugate. Luckily, little escapes Cé Vanri outside of the Conjugate's notice, so there are few who even know of this isolated band. Yet they exist. A coigreach in all but name: those who have escaped the Conjugate's network and returned to the isolation of singular egos. Reports vary wildly on why any sliver of the Conjugate would choose to leave, much less how they'd do it. Yet the Severed share a rare and dangerous heritage. A past that hunts them with singular focus.

- **Goal:** To gather their kin and escape Cé Vanri.
- **NPCs:** —
