# The Resheph Cluster

As far as the Resheph Cluster knows, they are alone. Trapped between two distinct forces of the Inference, the hostile A.I.s and their armies, who control the Gates that grant access to and egress from their Cluster. The only way to survive is resistance, but the colossal starships, infectious proxies, and swarming mechs of the Inference offer little quarter to humanity, who grow weary of the decades under siege. In the meantime, the required interdependence among the worlds of the Cluster and their responses to the ongoing war have only highlighted their differences in priorities, values, and interests. Nor could the Cluster survive without a fairweather friend: the fleet called the Vagabond Cynosure. The pirate flotilla profits off the siege of Resheph, as there a few ships among the Cluster worlds daring enough to travel through the unstable portals that allow for far more freedom than the Gates at the expense of safety and simplicity.

## The Makedo System

Of the systems in the Resheph Cluster, Makedo is closest to Pandora's Gate and the front of the war with the Inference. The forces of Nine gather beyond the Gate, sending regular incursions into the system. To protect themselves from mass upload, a strategy employed on other planets throughout the course of the war, the inhabitants of the Makedo System undergo a surgical and arcane process called "encrypting" upon reaching adulthood. This process results in protection from upload, but fails on a significant portion of the population. As a result, Sirmium, the system's single remaining populated world, is filled with encrypted humans and "faults", who roam the wilds with an unknown purpose.

### **Sirmium**

Several planets used to orbit Makedo's central stars, but now, after years of devastating war, only Sirmium remains. A weathered and war-torn rock amidst a sea of debris, both robotic and terrestrial alike. While the inhabitants of Sirmium are adjusted to their surroundings, interstellar visitors should take note of the inhospitable lifeforms which comprise the world's flora and fauna.

## The Kordin System

In a time of peace, the Kordin System was a beacon of civilization in the Resheph Cluster. Tarka's shining cities and prosperous citizens spread trade and high culture through the Cluster and beyond, while the denizens of Kastell worked honorably to provide the Cluster with wealth and splendor. The star at the heart of Kordin was the first to be targeted by the relativistic missiles of the Inference, a doom centuries in the making. With no way (yet) to prevent the assault and nowhere to flee, Tarka's illustrious leaders devised a plan. They would burn the heart of Tarka to create a Palisade that would shield Kastell from the cataclysm that would be unleashed when the Inference's attack finally reached their home. Now, the only souls who survive on Tarka possess bodies of metal, and all of them work to maintain the Palisade's integrity. Kastell, in spite of the shield that protects it from the galaxy, still proliferates supplies, but now its wares are more intoxicating, dangerous, and rare.

### Kastell

Kastell's Palisade glows ochre in the dark of space, and it opens rarely to visitors. Between the frosted highlands and frozen mountaintops are a people burned by the sacrifice of their home for survival and a people resentful of those who occupied their lands as soon as calamity cast its devastating shadow.

### Tarka

The once-thriving capital of the cluster, Tarka is now barely more than a searing battery powering the Palisade that the Kastellans hope will shield their futures. On the toxic planet, robots continue to roam, tweaking and repairing the shield's vital systems using the ruins of the former hegemony.

## The Cé Vanri System

Many years ago, all of the inhabitants of the Resheph Cluster considered how they might fight the coming war. How they could successfully resist the Influence. Many turned to force of arms and technological shielding. Some wielded the arcane to rend the Proxy-driven constructs apart or drive them into dimensions antithetical to our own. The inhabitants of Cé Vanri chose a different path. They understood that individuals could not repel the colossal wills of the Inference, to say nothing of their technological prowess. To fight back then required a grand joining. A majority of the planet joined what is now known as the Conjugate, a network of human minds and consciousnesses. From within the technological and mystical bond of the Conjugate, the people of Cé Vanri discovered peace and utopia. They have yet to discover a way to end the war.

### Cé Vanri

Cé Vanri is an icy world, but the Conjugate are welcoming to outsiders and sympathetic to those who remain on planet that refused to join with their network. The Conjugate's will is bent towards defeating the Inference, and only attempts to destabilize their carefully-crafted utopia draws their ire.

## The Avalon System

Avalon was always a paradise of transcendent beauty, boasting marvels the likes of which storytellers imagine existed long ago where humanity was born. Now, however, Avalon is no mere place of beauty, but the final star of the Resheph Cluster still free of the ravages of the war. With the Terminus Gate closed for fear of any of the Inference forces on the other side learning how to pass through, the Avalon system, and its central planet, Vulgate, is a hub for trade, a destination for war-weary citizens of the Cluster, and the apex of human culture in a war-torn reach of space. Vulgate is ruled by the Order of Ancyra, an aggressive faction of reactionaries whose anti-A.I. stance brought them to prominence when the Inference's murderous intent became clear. Since then, the Order of Ancyra has worked to ensure that technological and arcane advancement is heavily vetted within the system. Rumors abound as well of their spies, who seek to spread the same influence throughout the Cluster and sometimes, it is claimed, beyond the Terminus itself.

### Vulgate

Vulgate's natural wonder and magnificent artifice cannot be understated, particularly in an era where the great works of humanity are under heavy siege by the Inference. The Order of Ancyra and their enforcers safeguard this beauty with a vicious zealotry. Woe betide the offworlder whose tech or magic oversteps their dictates.

## The Vagabond Cynosure

On the edges of habited space, in the voids where the typical pilot would not even think to venture, sails the Vagabond Cynosure: a fleet of pirate vessels, hidden within the darkness of un-linked systems. For those brave enough to travel via the unstable portals, the Cynosure offers safe harbor from both the denizens of the Cluster and the war against the Inference itself. There are those that accuse the Vagabond fleet of cowardice or banditry, but the Resheph Cluster depends on the trade that flows through the Cynosure, and the Cynosure knows it.
